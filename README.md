The purpose of this project is to explore the impact of a set of variables like horsepower, transmission configuration, engine cylinder configuration, etc. on `mpg`(Miles per Gallon). In particular we have two objectives:---

1. To find which one of Automatic or Manual Transmission is better for `mpg`.
2. To Quantify the `mpg` difference b/w auto and manual transmissions.
3. To come up with a model to predict the mileage of a given car.
4. To find how a hundred pound increase in car's weight will change the fuel efficiency.
