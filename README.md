The purpose of this project is to explore the impact of a set of variables like horsepower, transmission configuration, engine cylinder configuration, etc. on `mpg`(Miles per Gallon). In particular we have two objectives:---

1. To find which one of Automatic or Manual Transmission is better for `mpg`.
2. To Quantify the `mpg` difference b/w auto and manual transmissions.
3. To come up with a model to predict the mileage of a given car.
4. To find how a hundred pound increase in car's weight will change the fuel efficiency.

The folder named Code contains all the code. The file named Code_MarkdownFormat contains an older version in which only first two objectives were taken up. In the second file named new_reg_mod.Rmd contains code for all four objectives. This Rmd was converted to HTML and published on Rpubs. Here's the link for it: http://rpubs.com/Nutan_Sahoo/Regression_Modelling It is easier to read and contains all graphis which were made using ggplot, base graphics and gplots.
